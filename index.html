          Hi, my name is Alima <br />I'm 18 years old . live in a Bishkek now ,
          and study in a "Makers" courses. I have been studing hear for 2 weeks.
          I rally like the positivity here. <br />
          I all day long trying to anderstand title . «In my opinion, if a
          teenager receives proper education they are more equipped <br />
          for a life ahead of them. First, formal education provides youngsters
          with important life skills such as literacy and numeracy skills, as
          <br />
          well as critical thinking. Without those, one can barely get through a
          day without a struggle. Furthermore, it is inevitable that the younger
          <br />
          generation will face situations <br />
          in their adulthood when their rights are compromised. However, having
          received formal education,<br />
          they will be able <br />
          to recognise when it happens and ensure their rights are respected.»

              Christmas which is celebrated on December 25th is an important
              Christian holiday. The origin of the word “Christmas” comes from
              “Christ” and the “Holy Mass”. It is believed that the day
              commemorates the birth of Jesus Christ although a lot of people
              doubt that the Day corresponds to the actual date of his birth. In
              spite of its Christian origin, Christmas is also celebrated by a
              lot of non Christian countries and the celebration includes a lot
              of non religious customs. People exchange gifts and greeting
              cards. Homes are decorated with Christmas trees, light and
              garlands. Dinners are planned with special food and all the
              families gather to have a lot of fun

              The existence of stereotypes may be explained by the need of
              groups of people to view themselves as more normal or more
              superior than other groups. Consequently, stereotypes may be used
              to justify ill-founded prejudices or ignorance and prevent people
              of stereotyped groups from entering or succeeding in various
              activities or fields. The stereotyping groups are, generally,
              reluctant to reconsider their attitudes and behavior towards
              stereotyped group.

              Spring is a time when flowers bloom and trees begin to grow and
              reproduce. The days grow longer and the temperature in most areas
              becomes more temperate. You can also contemplate the melting of
              ice and thawing of the ground. The weather during this period
              becomes much sunnier while hibernating animals begin to come out
              of hibernation.
